# Dining Notifier
### (Really just Feast Notifier for now)

A simple Android app to fix a simple problem!
Have you ever gotten tired of checking what UCLA Dining has in store today? Well I sure did, to the point where I wrote a scraping script I ran every morning that told me what FEAST had today, and if BPlate or De Neve had my favorite items there (Steak or Chicken Noodle Soup). However, having to check that manually was also tedious, so I decided to finally learn how to make simple Android Apps and automate one annoying task in the process! Dining Notifier pushes a notification every morning that says what food FEAST has on the menu, and opening the app gives you full descriptions and hyperlinks to each item.

Compatible with Android versions over 11
Happy FEASTing!
